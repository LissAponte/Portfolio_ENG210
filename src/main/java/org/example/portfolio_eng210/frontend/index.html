            <h3>A little about me!</h3>
            <p>I was born on and raised in Puerto Rico. Right after highschool I went immediately to university.
            This is where Neumont University comes into play. From dreaming big to actually taking that first big step,
            college classes have been helping me mold into the professional I want to be. The biggest aspiration I have is
                to implement my creativity in web based apps for the public use(Client/Costumer service, etc). In this portfolio, I hope to continue
            to update my projects and skills as I learn and master them.</p>
